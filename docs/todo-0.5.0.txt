ElDewrito:
- implement stats submissions (only need to find/generate unique matchID field)
- fix info server showing blank variant name
- fix info server still running after host joins a different game
- we need a build of medals.dll that is built with the /MT flag, doesn't start a console, doesn't generate MessageBoxes, uses the /mods/medals folder instead of HALO_ROOT and checks if halo3.zip exists first before launching

DewritoLauncher:
- allow the user to choose the update channel they want to use (channels.json on the update server will list the channel names and urls)

Master server:
- store stats data on at least one master, stats display site doesn't have to be ready yet.. but we MUST save peoples stats on at least one master
  ^ that way when we do have a stats display site ready we can display stats since the start of 0.5.0 release

Server browser:
- use dewrito.json file to find the master servers to query and query all of them for server IPs, after querying + combining IP lists then contact each server
- implement passworded server support

VoIp:
- SDK Documentation:          https://halowiki.llf.to/ts3_sdk/client_html/index.html
- D3d menu with microphone settings, Voice activation detection, auto gain control, mic volume, etc
- D3d menu with current list of people in VoIP with mute buttons (if server host, kick/gag!)
- D3d menu of current players should show their team color (or grey if non team game) also would be nice to determain if the player is dead or alive while talking (maybe put a skull next to their name)
- Add preferences and command arguments for changing and storing VoIP settings
- use upnp to port forward

Chat UI:
- fix users still being in the game IRC channel after they've left
- add a way for (server host/OP of game IRC channel) to kick everyone from the channel when server closes down
- fix chat UI showing game chat msgs on global chat tab
- fix chat UI showing the full string (PRIVMSG !dew1234 #haloonline : Hi there!) for some messages
- (possibly) make chat UI key mapped to the "Chat" ingame key (right now remapping ingame keys seems broke though, but I'm sure it worked fine before)
- add transparency
- add color codes
- fix mouse scrolling so that it works outside of game (need to register mouse raw input device)
- TEST TEST TEST the UI for bugs 

Menu:
- fix cookie loading (cookie saving works)

The top half of above must be sorted (before VoIP section) before we push anything to the main update server.
Any further betas pushed must be precise. 0.5.0 branch is only for fixing/adding new things to the TODO above.
